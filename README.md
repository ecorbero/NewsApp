Succesfully updated gaurav822's NewsApp to flutter 3.0. 

There is still a few small bugs:
- Button images do not download (todo: actually we want to remove them)

## Information about the project

This Flutter News app uses the newsapi (https://newsapi.org/) to Search worldwide news with code.

Newsapi let's you locate articles and breaking news headlines from news sources and blogs across the web with their JSON API.


## Getting Started

Steps:
1. Get an API key from Newsapi.org
2. Find both instances of "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY" in the file "./lib/helper/news.dart", and change it to your own api key (from step 1)
3. You can run the Flutter app, an dtest it.
