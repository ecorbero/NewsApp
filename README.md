## Information about the project

This Flutter News app uses the newsapi (https://newsapi.org/) to Search worldwide news with code.

Newsapi let's you locate articles and breaking news headlines from news sources and blogs across the web with their JSON API.


## Getting Started

Steps:
1. Get an API key from Newsapi.org
2. Find both instances of "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY" in the file "./lib/helper/news.dart", and change it to your own api key (from step 1)
3. You can run the Flutter app, and test it.
